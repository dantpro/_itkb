How to create a PEM file from existing certificate files that form a chain
---

(optional) Remove the password from the Private Key by following the steps listed below:

> openssl rsa -in server.key -out nopassword.key
 
Combine the private key, public certificate and any 3rd party intermediate certificate files:
---
> cat nopassword.key > server.pem
> cat server.crt >> server.pem

Note: Repeat this step as needed for third-party certificate chain files, bundles, etc:

cat intermediate.crt >> server.pem
