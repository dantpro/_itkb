QNAS UPS name: qnapups, username/passwd =admin/123456
ASUSTOR asustor, admin/1111

OK, I got this working with just NUT server and not homeassistant.

In /etc/nut directory, edit upsd.users and add:

[admin]
password = 1111
upsmon primary

then make the name of the UPS in ups.conf to be asustor

[asustor]
driver = usbhid-ups
port = auto
desc = "Asustor"
vendorid=nnnn
productid=nnnn

Your vendorid and productid will vary.

Then sudo service nut-server restart or just reboot the RPi

Now go to adm and set ADM to point to the RPi IP address and test. This works for me.
